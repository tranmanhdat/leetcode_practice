Hint
You are given a 0-indexed string pattern of length n consisting of the characters 'I' meaning increasing and 'D' meaning decreasing.

A 0-indexed string num of length n + 1 is created using the following conditions:

num consists of the digits '1' to '9', where each digit is used at most once.
If pattern[i] == 'I', then num[i] < num[i + 1].
If pattern[i] == 'D', then num[i] > num[i + 1].
Return the lexicographically smallest possible string num that meets the conditions.

 

Example 1:

Input: pattern = "IIIDIDDD"
Output: "123549876"
Explanation:
At indices 0, 1, 2, and 4 we must have that num[i] < num[i+1].
At indices 3, 5, 6, and 7 we must have that num[i] > num[i+1].
Some possible values of num are "245639871", "135749862", and "123849765".
It can be proven that "123549876" is the smallest possible num that meets the conditions.
Note that "123414321" is not possible because the digit '1' is used more than once.
Example 2:

Input: pattern = "DDD"
Output: "4321"
Explanation:
Some possible values of num are "9876", "7321", and "8742".
It can be proven that "4321" is the smallest possible num that meets the conditions.
 

Constraints:

1 <= pattern.length <= 8
pattern consists of only the letters 'I' and 'D'.

# Solve

## Backtracking
using backtracking to get all results, then take the minimum

## Minimum

since we need the minimum result, we relize the characteristic of the string result:
+ the origin minimum string: 123456789
+ we go from 0 position, every time we meet D, let count the numbers of D before meet I, then we add the reverse of array by stack. For example: If the patternm, is IIIDDDIII, so the first is 123, then we count 3 D then meet I, so we add 654, then we can continue like that by adding 789
